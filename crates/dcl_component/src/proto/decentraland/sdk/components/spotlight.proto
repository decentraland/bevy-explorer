// spotlights are point lights that emit light only in a cone around the transform's forward direction.
// add this component together with the PbLight component to transform a point light into a spotlight.
// note that spotlights do not model any internal reflections / focus, they only restrict the area of effect.
// so for e.g. a torch beam, the bulb illuminance should be multiplied by the solid angle. 
// a typical torch with a beam width of 15 degrees would use outer angle of 0.15 (7.5 degrees in radians),
// and an illuminance approximately equal to the bulb's lumens, e.g. 1200.
